# osdev
An attempt at doing things properly this time. Compile by running build.sh, which runs all the commands for you. (too lazy to learn make)


Binaries, such as the kernel ELF executable (for debugging,) or the ISO image (for running,) will be located under the "bin" folder, and will be generated during the build process.
